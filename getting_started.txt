getting set up:

1. I'm using the Git Shell from GitHub for Windows, which is a powershell based shell.
2. Every time you start up the shell, run the setenv.ps1 script from the root.
3. Now, you're ready to go. To build the boot loader (boot.bin), change to boot/ folder and
   run 'fasm boot.asm boot.bin'.
4. To run the boot loader in the emulator, run 'qemu boot.bin', which will boot it up.

enjoy!
