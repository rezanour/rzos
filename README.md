Building a simple OS just for fun

#
# getting set up:
#
# 1. I'm using the Git Shell from GitHub for Windows, which is a powershell based shell.
# 2. Every time you start up the shell, run the setenv.ps1 script from the root.
# 3. Now, you're ready to go. To build the boot loader (boot.bin), change to boot/ folder and
#    run 'fasm boot.asm boot.bin'.
# 4. To run the boot loader in the emulator, run 'qemu boot.bin', which will boot it up.
#

# enjoy!
